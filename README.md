Solutions, mostly written in the python language.  

I love adventofcode, it's a great idea to practice your skills and intuition in
programming and a great place to learn about algorithms and principles in
computer science. Especially for a lateral entrant to IT like me.  

I started 2018 with some more or less naive approaches.  
Older days were added later, when I found some time to enjoy puzzling.  

The solutions are not complete, due to lack of time ;-)  
They are kinda sloppy too :P  

Enjoy.
